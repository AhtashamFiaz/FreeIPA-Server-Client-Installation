FreeIPA Server & Client Setup

This guide provides a clear step-by-step process for setting up FreeIPA with DNS integration on a Fedora server.

Requirement:
Fedora Server + FQDN

Fedora 38 
FreeIpa version: 4.10.2

Change Hostname:
hostname freeipa.shuftiapps.com

Edit /etc/hosts:
Add an entry for your server's IP and domain name:

Allow Ports in the Firewall:
firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port={80/tcp,443/tcp,389/tcp,636/tcp,88/tcp,464/tcp,53/tcp,88/udp,464/udp,53/udp,123/udp}
firewall-cmd --reload

Install FreeIPA Server with DNS:
dnf install freeipa-server-dns

Start FreeIPA Installation with DNS and Allow Zone Overlap:
ipa-server-install --setup-dns --allow-zone-overlap

If the httpd service fails to start, manually start it:
systemctl start httpd.service
		Set NTP (Network Time Protocol) Servers:
		Add the NTP servers as prompted during the FreeIPA setup.
		Set Passwords:
		Set passwords for the Directory Manager and the Admin user as prompted during the setup.
Add Firewall Rules for FreeIPA and DNS services:
firewall-cmd --add-service freeipa-4 --permanent
firewall-cmd --add-service dns --permanent
firewall-cmd --reload

Check the Status of FreeIPA:
ipactl status

Access the FreeIPA Web Interface:
Access the FreeIPA web interface by entering the domain name 

Note on DNS Configuration:
Depending on your server's network setup (local VM or dedicated public IP), you may need to modify the /etc/hosts file on the local computer or server to ensure DNS resolution.



FreeIPA Client Setup 

Prerequisites
A FreeIPA Server that the client will join
Sudo access to the server or user with sudo access
Internet access from the sever
1. Update system
Ensure that the system packages are updated
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade

2. Installing FreeIPA packages
FreeIPA client is available on repositories for Ubuntu. Install it using the command:
sudo apt install -y freeipa-client
Confirm client addition using this command
apt-cache policy freeipa-client

2. Seting up client
sudo nano etc/hosts
10.2.40.149 ipa.citizix.com      // freeipa server ip and domain name 
10.2.40.70 ubuntu-client.citizix.com. // client ip and FQDN hostname

Set your system hostname.
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname  hostname.domain.com

Update the timezone to your timezone:
Check time zone of FreeIPA server 
Then match your client time zone 

timedatectl 
sudo timedatectl set-timezone Asia/Karachi

We can then setup client with specifying FreeIPA server and domain name
Replace server with your freeipa server hostname and domain with your domain name 

sudo ipa-client-install --server=ipa.citizix.com --domain ipa.citizix.com

Proceed with fixed values and no DNS discovery? 
Yes
Do you want to configure chrony with NTP server or pool address? [no]: no
Continue to configure the system with these values? [no]: yes

3. Enable Creation of home directories on the first Login
sudo bash -c "cat > /usr/share/pam-configs/mkhomedir" <<EOF

Name: activate mkhomedir
Default: yes
Priority: 900
Session-Type: Additional
Session:
required pam_mkhomedir.so umask=0022 skel=/etc/skel
EOF

Then run:
sudo pam-auth-update

Ensure  “activate mkhomedir” is selected, it should have [*]. Select .

4. Test Client addition
To test that the client was added successfully, let us login with a user in freeipa. If its the first time you are logging in, you should see a password change prompt else you will see this:
ssh isa-client@ip
Exit

You can administer FreeIPA Server from the client machine using ipa command line tool.
kinit admin

Test by adding a user account and listing accounts present:
sudo ipa user-add kip \
     --first=Kipkoech \
     --last=Towett \
     --email=kip@citizix.com \
     --password
Verify.
 ipa user-find kip
